game details:
- this is a platformer, without stages, just a continuous progress to the right.
- the star is a ninja-fox.
- the goal is to collect stars and kill enemies (you get points for both)
- there are platforms, on top the fox can jump, and spaces that he can fall through
- there are enemies that the fox needs to jump over, on top of or kill with jump, swirly ninja kick or a sword.

user controls:
- use wasd keys to move
- z for kick, x for sword stab

visiblity:
- 8 bit platformer, beautiful
- starting with a splash screen that i need to press space to start, like old Atari games
- add great matching music
- look and feel like an amazing 90s game

instructions:
